#Question 1

Adult male height (X) follows (approximately) a normal distribution with a mean of 69 inches and a standard deviation of 2.8 inches.

What proportion of males are more than 75 inches tall? In other words, what is P(X > 75)?

In other words, I'm looking for the area shaded in the following image:

![Question 1 graph](1.JPG)

```{r}
pop.mean = 69
pop.sd = 2.8
boundary =75
area = 1 - pnorm(boundary, mean= pop.mean, sd=pop.sd)
```
The probability of a randomly selected man being `r boundary` inches or taller is: `r area`.

#Question 2

Adult male height (x) follows a normal distribution with a mean of 69 inches and a standard deviation of 2.8 inches.

What proportion of males are between 66 and 72 inches tall? In other words, what is P(66 < X <72)?

In other words, I'm looking for the area shaded in the following image:

![Question 2 graph](1 (1).JPG)

```{r}
pop.mean = 69
pop.sd = 2.8
boundaryOne =72
boundaryTwo = 66
areaOne = pnorm(boundaryOne, mean= pop.mean, sd=pop.sd)
areaTwo = pnorm(boundaryTwo, mean= pop.mean, sd=pop.sd)
areaFinal = areaOne - areaTwo
```

The probability of a randomly selected man being between `r boundaryTwo` and `r boundaryOne` inches tall is: `r areaFinal`.

#Question 3

A random sample of 100 students is taken from the population of all part-time students in the US, for which the overall proportion of females is 0.6.

There is a 70% chance that the sample proportion falls between what two values?

In other words, I'm looking for the area shaded in the following image:

![Question 3 graph](1 (2).JPG)

```{r}
sampleSize = 100
pop.prop = .6
sample.prop = .7
pop.q = 1- pop.prop
pop.sd = sqrt((pop.q * pop.prop) / sampleSize)
secondX = qnorm(.85, mean=pop.prop, sd=pop.sd)
firstX = qnorm(.15, mean=pop.prop, sd=pop.sd)
```

There is a 70% chance that the sample proportion falls in between `r firstX` and `r secondX`.

#Question 4 

The proportion of left-handed people in the general population is about 0.1. Suppose a random sample of 225 people is observed.

What is the probability that 40 or more people in the sample are left-handed? 


In other words, I'm looking for the area shaded in the following image:
 
![Question 4 graph](1 (3).JPG)

```{r}
sampleSize = 225
pop.prop = .1
sample.prop = 40/225
pop.q = 1- pop.prop
pop.sd = sqrt((pop.q * pop.prop) / sampleSize)
firstX = pnorm(sample.prop, mean=pop.prop, sd=pop.sd)
area = 1 - firstX
```

The probability that 40 or more people in the sample are left-handed is `r area`.
